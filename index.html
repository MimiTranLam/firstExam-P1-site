            <h2>What is CLI?</h2>
            <p>CLI stands for Command Line Interface. Users can interact with a system or application by typing in text commands.</p>

            <h2>What is the adv/disadv of CLI?</h2>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Advantages: <br />
                    - Can carry out multiple actions in a single application? <br />
                    - Do everything by just typing. "Type faster than you can click". <br />
                    - If there is an error or a wrong text command is used, the cli will clearly state what the error is and suggest
                    alternate solutions.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Disadvantages: <br />
                    - On top of knowing coding rules of other languages, there are also alot of commands to learn. (eg. If you don't remember how to make a folder and cd into it, there is more typing to do than just in one single command).
                </p>
            </div>

            <h2>Which do you prefer, CLI or GUI? Why?</h2>
            <p>I like a mix of both.</p>

            <h2>Which command to check your current directory?</h2>
            <p>Either "pwd" to see the path file and name of the directory OR "ls" to list out all the contents of a directory.</p>

            <h2>Which command to create a new folder/directory?</h2>
            <p>Type "mkdir *dirname*" to make and name a folder/dir.</p>

            <h2>Which command to create a new file?</h2>
            <p>Type "touch _filename_" and format/language (eg. ".js") to make and name a specific file and type of file.</p>

            <h2>You are in Desktop folder, which command to make a new directory name coderschool and navigate inside it?</h2>
            <p><ol id="q7">
                <li>Check you're in the correct folder/dir that you want to make the folder in by "pwd" or "ls".</li>
                <li>Type "mkdir && cd _dirname_" to make and name a folder/dir and navigate inside it.</li>
            </ol></p>

            <h2>Which command to delete a file?</h2>
            <p>Type "rm _filename_" to remove a file.</p>

            <h2>Which command to delete a non-empty folder?</h2>
            <p>Type "rm -rf _dirname_ to delete a non empty folder/dir.</p>

            <h2>What does this command do?</h2>
            <p>Creates a .md (markdown) file and writes a string of text into the .md file.</p>

                <h2>What does the . mean in this command?</h2>
                <p>Means "all". In this command it will add all files in the current working dir to the git repo.</p>
        
                <h2>What does the -m mean, is it OK without -m in this command?</h2>
                <p>Means git commit message. In this command the user makes a commit to the git repo and names the commit.</p>
        
                <h2>What does the -M mean in this command?</h2>
                <p>Makes a master branch.</p>
        
                <h2>What do origin and main mean in this command?</h2>

                <h2>Which command to initialise a git repo in local?</h2>

                <h2>Inside head tag, what does first meta tag mean?</h2>
                <p>Declares use of UTF-8 character encoding. Declaring this allows the browser to know to convert typed characters
                (human-readable text) into machine-readable code and vice versa.</p>
        
                <h2>Inside head tag, what does second meta tag mean?</h2>
                <p>"viewport" indicates the area of display screen on the client's side. The second part of the meta tag gives instructions
                to the browser on how to control the webpage's dimensions and scaling. "width=device-width" sets the webpage content
                (information to be displayed) width to the client's device width. "user-scalable=no" disables browser zoom-in on both
                mobile and desktop devices. "initial-scale=1.0" sets the zoom level when the page is first loaded. "maximum-scale=1.0"
                sets the limit on how much the user can zoom as the parameter, in this case it doesn't allow the user to zoom in.
                "minimum-scale=1.0" also controls zoom.</p>
        
                <h2>Inside head tag, what is wrong with link tag?</h2>
                <p>The link to the css stylesheet is incorrect. Instead of linking as source, it should be a "href" attribute to specify
                it's destination in relation to the current resource (the HTML file/document). A "src" is used to embed a resource into
                the webpage.</p>
        
                <h2>List some tags that do not have closing tag?</h2>
                <p><ul>
                    <li>link</li>
                    <li>img</li>
                    <li>input</li>
                </ul>
                These self-closing tags cannot have child elements.
                </p>
        
                <h2>Give some contexts of using span tag?</h2>
                <p>A "span" tag is a generic inline container. It does not start on new line and only takes up the necessary width (with
                the flow).<br/>
                For eg. Spotify exercise: the links in the navbar, contain a "|" in a span tag to separate the two sides of links while
                keeping everything on the same line.</p>
                    
                <h2>Give 1 example of creating a hyperlink by a tag in html? (answer with HTML code)</h2>
                <p>
                    Use the "a" tag. Must include source by href linking and a closing tag.
                    <code><a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/premium/">Premium</a></code>
                </p>

                <h2>Give 1 example of inserting a picture in html? (answer with HTML code)</h2>
                <p>
                    Use the self-closing "img" tag. Must include source of/path to image with "src" and alternate text if the image cannot be displayed with "alt" (to let a user know what is meant to be displayed).
                    <code><img src="./images/balloon.png" alt="balloon"></code>
                </p>
                
                <h2>Give 1 example of creating an email link in html? (answer with HTML code)</h2>
                <p>
                    Use the "a" tag. Must include source by href linking and a closing tag. The URI scheme "mailto: " allows users to click on the hyperlink and send an email to the specific address linked in the hyperlink tag.
                    <code><a href="mailto: mimitranlam1212@gmail.com">Some text</a></code>
